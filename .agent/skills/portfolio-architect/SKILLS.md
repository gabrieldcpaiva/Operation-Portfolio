# Portfolio Architect

## Instructions
1. **Orientation Detection:** Scan portfolio_images/.

If Portrait: Apply vertical framing with "Leica" white-space borders.
If Landscape: Apply strict 16:9 cinematic "Cine-Strip" logic.

## Salgado Protocol: For the 'Portraits' collection, use high-contrast B&W filters and vertical orientation.

## Lanacore Logic: For the 'Lanacore' sector, apply a "Nostalgic/Hazy" CSS overlay (slight grain + warm/cool split tone).

# Constraints
**No distortion. No forced crops.**
**The frame serves the image, not the other way around.**
