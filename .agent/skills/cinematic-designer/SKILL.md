# Cinematic Designer Skill

**Goal:** 
Ensure the portfolio looks like a high-end, cinematic experience rather than a standard web template. The aesthetic is "Minimalist Luxury" and "Analog Aesthetics."

**Design Instructions:**
1. **The Void Principle:** Text and images must float cleanly on the dark background. Remove harsh background "cards," bounding boxes, or visible container borders.
2. **Typography:** Use elegant, high-contrast typography. Pair a refined serif font for headers with a clean, highly legible sans-serif (like Inter or Helvetica) for body text. 
3. **Spacing & Air:** Double the standard padding and margins. Let the elements breathe. The layout should feel expensive and uncrowded.
4. **Cinematic Centering:** When displaying galleries or lightboxes, center them perfectly like a cinema screen. 
5. **Interactive Elements:** Buttons should be minimalist (e.g., a simple 1px subtle white border or a clean text link with an arrow) rather than clunky, colored rectangles.

**Constraints:**
- Do not use bright, saturated UI colors. Stick to pure black, dark grays, stark whites, and subtle gold accents if necessary.
- Do not build standard "web cards" for the Gumroad products. Let the product covers speak for themselves.

**Always center your refinements on an audience of discerning design professionals and clients who prioritize meticulous craftsmanship, nostalgic elegance, and cinematic beauty in portfolio experiences.**
