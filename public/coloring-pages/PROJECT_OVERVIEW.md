## 🙏 The Heart of the Campaign

### Core Values
1. **Faith** - "Foi Deus que nos trouxe até você"
2. **Love** - Genuine care for families in need
3. **Hope** - Belief that things can get better
4. **Community** - We're stronger together
5. **Authenticity** - Real people helping real people

### The Story
In 2015, Jéssica Rocio started donating 2-3 food baskets to families in need in Eunápolis, Bahia. It was small, but it was something.

In 2017, her husband Lineker joined the effort.

In 2021, their son Yure was born on December 19—just 6 days before Christmas. His birth transformed the campaign from a kind gesture into a sacred mission.

Now, in 2025, the Natal Solidário do Yure reaches more families than ever, powered by faith, love, and the support of people like you.

### The Mission
Every food basket represents more than just food. It represents:
- A family that won't go hungry
- Children who will have a Christmas meal
- Parents who feel seen and supported
- Hope that they're not alone
- Faith that God provides through His people
