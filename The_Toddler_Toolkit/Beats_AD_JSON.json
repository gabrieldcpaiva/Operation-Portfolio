"subject": "a product showcase advertisement for Beats by Dre headphones",
"camera_position": "hovering robotic arm camera smoothly circling the headphones with mechanical precision (that’s where the camera is)",
"location": "a futuristic neon-lit tech lab with reflective black walls, illuminated floor grids, and animated digital interface projections in the background",
"action": "the headphones float in mid-air inside a rotating magnetic field, illuminated by pulsing blue and white lights; digital schematics briefly flash across their surface before a model with cyberpunk styling steps forward, places them on, and syncs to the beat with a confident nod",
"visual_style_and_lighting": "ultra-modern tech aesthetic with glowing neon accents, glitch overlays, blue ambient underlighting, and synthetic reflections on polished surfaces",
"movement_quality": "precise, futuristic, and robotic—clean mechanical pans and smooth magnetic levitation motion",
"camera_motion_and_composition": "automated robotic arm orbit shots, dynamic push-ins with synthetic lens flares and slight parallax effect, sharp focus transitions with holographic overlays",
"dialogue": "voiceover saying: 'Beats by Dre. Engineered for the future of sound.'",
