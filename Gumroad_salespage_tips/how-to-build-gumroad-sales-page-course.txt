What is up y'all so today we are going to go over our new course how to build a high converting government sales page The reason we're building this is because so many creators are good at doing what they do meaning they're very good at their craft but when it comes down to Creating a high converting sales page That's something more that marketers are good at and so we want to solve that problem and create this blueprint to help you build a very high Converting government sales page so that traffic that you're sending to your product starts converting and starts converting to become customer So let's get right into it. So the first thing we're gonna go over is a seven part blueprint to build your sales page This is something that I interviewed a gumroad creator and we went over this seven part blueprint that he uses for his Clients to build high converting gumroad sales pages. So we're gonna go through all seven steps or all seven parts right now So the first one is the big idea right in Daniel Visayo's case This is for his course. 

Everyone can build a Twitter audience. So this is your h1 This is your big bold idea. And this is every this is like the main point that you want to get across to To a customer. 

This is you telling them. This is what I do for you So why so your product service should focus on one big bold and brilliant idea this one idea sets the tone For the rest of your sales page. This big idea should be the bold claim You promise to deliver on the back end of your product. 

So this is like when a customer Gets on your gumroad sales page and they read the first headline This is the first thing that they're gonna read and therefore it is essential that it Screams what you do and the problem that you solve when I read it as a customer I should have no confusion of what your product does for me So let's dive into the best practices One of the best ways to determine your big idea is to communicate what your product does Once determined use it to communicate the idea that defines your product many gum road carriers first solved a personal problem and converted that Problem into a product. This is then used as the base for their big idea Your big idea will give you will live sorry as your h1 and then everything following Part of this this blueprint will bring your big idea to life. So every other headline every other Piece of copy supports your big idea and helps bring it to life So the second part is not the big problem Making money shouldn't be hard or making money online. 

Shouldn't be hard. So After you've given your big idea. You want to now give you want to like a Address the big problem your audience faces He's now you're telling you first you're telling them what you solve and now you're telling the problem You're trying to connect with them by telling them the problems that they're facing and then how your product right solves these problems So in this case making money online shouldn't be hard This is the big problem if you can address problems and you could you can open the door to to presenting your Product as the solution to these problems So why every customer who is in search of a product is really in search of a solution to a problem and if the problem exists for one person then exists for other people by addressing the big problem a Consumer faces you open the door for a solution and particularly your solution aka your product That's why it's important to address the the essentially the elephant in the room, which is the problem that your Ideal target audience is facing because if you don't address the problem Then you can never kind of set up the runway to introduce your product, right? So the second what we're gonna now dive into is the best practices Which is the second headline on your sales page should address the biggest problem your target audience faces You can determine this by talking to consumers who think you would who think Who you think would benefit from your product by doing so You'll be able to determine the common denominators in the problems they face or in the solutions They see this will help you determine how to position the problem in a way where it opens the door for you to introduce your product I think I touch on this later. 

But one really Good way of approaching this is to read customer reviews on competing products By doing so you're able to see what customers complain about and also what they think is good about that product by really seeing what they complain about you're able to take their complaints and position it as The big problem which is perfect for you because you're literally taking the words and and using it to influence the copy That will then determine how you position your big problem Next we're gonna go over the big promise. So the big after you've addressed The big problem you want to make the big promise the big promise is essentially Your promise to deliver on the back end of your product So it's like the value creation that you promise to create without having yet created it because you set the expectation with your big promise Consumers aren't just gonna believe. Oh you solve this problem No, they want you to tell them what to expect from it and then deliver a promise on that expectation So that they can see then they can visualize themselves succeeding and solving that problem. 

So in this case The big promises learn the exact daily weekly and monthly system I use on LinkedIn to go from 2,000 to 110,000 followers and 1.2 million dollars in income with a with Absolutely zero ads this tells a consumer exactly what they're gonna learn They're gonna learn how to grow an audience and specifically how this person went from 2,000 to over 110,000 followers and then how they generated 1.2 million dollars in income without spending any money in ads So why why do why is it important to? To put your big promise on your sales base So your big promise is a success on the back end of your product This helps a consumer visualize their problem being eliminated a consumer with an eliminated problem is a happy customer If you don't promise success and customers will never see themselves using your products consumer consumers will only buy products That promise to fix problems. And so with this is it's the best practices are simple Don't get fancy tell your honest directly what they will do or achieve after using your product. It's a simple formula by using X You will achieve Y take this formula and use a specific keywords that resonate with your audience to write copy that triggers emotions So me personally like I have I am building a paid newsletter called the growth ball and so when I have my When I'm creating my big promise, it's it's the growth ball will deliver case studies that will help you optimize your marketing efforts It's very simple It is direct and it tells you exactly what my product is gonna help you do and that's my big promise And so that's what you want to keep this you want to make sure to include this so that consumers know that you are That your product delivers on yours on the solution that you promise So forth is your unique selling proposition your unique selling proposition is what separates you for the competition It's what tells the consumers that your product is the right solution for them because it does X better than competitors. 

So Obviously we have there is if you're releasing products there is competition but one thing that we talk about constantly in our articles in the government newsletter is if You can create this like what they call a personal monopoly where Consumers are excited to buy your product because it's you then you win and a lot of times that can be your unique Selling proposition, but in this case your unique selling proposition is the intersection of what customers want What your competitors do well and what you do well if you can find this At the intersection of these three things you could find how you can position yourself To be unique to differentiate yourself from the competitors Then you are basically creating a new subset of a category and placing your in stamping your self in there So here you'll find your USB and what put finds and find what positions you in a way where you separate yourself from the competition Because this is there's new creators every single day and there's new creators in your domain every single day But by positioning it you could almost create a subset category where you have no competition So how can we develop your unique selling proposition? So let's go over the best practices We want to position your product as the best solution that your competition doesn't offer So here's the framework to use the first thing identify the main problem your product solves Basic the next thing showcase the benefits that make a customer's life better Third describe the value behind these benefits Fourth intersect the customer's problems with your benefits Five find your differentiation factor where your value outweighs the competition And don't confuse your value proposition with a cat phrase. You want this to be clear and concise You don't want to try to be clever in many in Too many times creators try to be clever instead of being clear. You want to obsess over clarity. 

So your value proposition Clearly defines what you do better than the competition and communicates the results on the back end of purchasing your product again, one of the best ways to find your unique selling proposition as well is to read negative customer reviews Based on your your competitors products here You will find everything that they complain about and how and then be able to manipulate that so that you could position your product as The right product so the fifth is the unique mechanism if your unique value proposition is a solution that you make a reality Your unique mechanism mechanism is how your product delivers the value slash solution Customers don't only want to know what your product does What problem it solves, but most importantly how you make it a reality So your unique mechanism gives customers confidence that you're going to deliver on that product If I just say I do x or I help you solve x but I don't tell you The secret sauce essentially or the recipe behind creating Creating that success then because consumers aren't just going to believe you they want to know how how do I deliver that right? if if i'm selling even Uh, for example, like nike nike does a good job at this They'll they'll say this this shoe helps your performance But then they will break down how it may it how the shoe actually helps your performance, right? Apple does the same thing and and so on so without a unique mechanism. Your product is positioned as a Commodity and that's not what we want in this case. We want to deliver Uh position your product. 

Sorry as the product that's needed It's it's it's it's vital It's vital to the to the problem that you are trying to solve or the the solution that you are in search of So the best practices are you want to position your unique mechanism as the untold story? Because by telling the untold story You show customers what they've never seen before or something that they've never heard before the story that differentiates You from the competition converting your product from a commodity to a novelty To find this find communities where your audience lives And dig for the problems that they're talking about and then read the negative reviews for competing products Like I stated that earlier and then these negative reviews are opportunities for you to develop your unique mechanism the best thing I would say here is the Is looking at the the reviews for competing products and then find these communities inject yourself into these communities To be able to communicate with people that are in your exact target audience And find how you can communicate what you do to them in a way that they find it intriguing. So the next element of creating a High converting gumroad sales page is injecting social proof into your sales page um, someone that does this really well is the Black Hat wizard with and especially in his cold email mastery course If you go to and and we send you a download or uh, I send you a link later In this course where I break down his his sales page But if you go through his sales page, you'll notice that he has just ample amounts of social proof And i'm not talking about just you know, like testimonials and like, uh putting someone's quote Within your sales page, but actually just screenshotting um twitter content and twitter like tweets about his course and putting him in his um In his page and the reason I like that is because It's him sharing real people with real results. You can't fake a tweet, right? Like you can't fake Somebody going on twitter and putting how much this your product has helped them. 

So let's go over this So why the social proof that lives on your sales page is in the essential asset You're promising that your product makes the customer's life better and solves x problems But without the proof your promise is just a claim And the social proof that lives on your site puts future customers in the shoes of current customers It helps them visualize the better life on the other side of your products Social proof also takes advantage of the bandwagon effect where people do what other people have done Um, like I kind of mentioned earlier for best practices like the cold email wizard takes screenshots of testimonials and mentions from social media This is essential or something I like because you're using your social real estate and implementing it into Your sales page. Uh, these screenshots will feel native and authentic on your sales page Another option is to include testimonials in your product video um Like they say the proof is in the pudding real people want to see real people generating real results and solving real problems and the keyword in all this is real so if the the More authentic you can make your social proof feel to a consumer The higher chances of them believing it and and trusting that You are going to deliver on the promises and the problems that you say that you solve So the last part is uh, one of the most important and that is creating an irresistible offer Why so your your customers commits, right? They're ready to take action and now it's your job to urge them to complete the purchase This is a result of an unresistible offer mixed with a sense of urgency Effective irresistible offers leverage bundling price schemes pricing seems sorry time sensitivity and risk reversal This way customers feel like they're maximizing every dollar they give you and feel secure in their decision So what are the some of the best practices for this? So we want consumers to feel confident when they purchase your product, right? We uh confident consumers act and if someone doesn't feel Uh confident in their decision to purchase your product. They're gonna bounce right they're gonna exit and you can Now as it would be your job to try to get them to come back So instead we want to make them feel confident in their decision that this is the the right decision This is the right product and they're going this is going to make their life better and solve x products So your your customer should feel like the second they purchase your product They 10 x their month. 

So by doing so you will have a customer for life So here's how a lot of government creators do that. They bundle on extras for customers or Uh, they increase the price every few days or after a set number of customers. So let's say you you Day one of your product or week one of your products is fifty dollars week two sixty dollars week three seventy dollars Another one is like you can Let's say you'll you'll sell 15 of your product At 50 and then the next 15 will go to 60 etc. 

So you could just keep increasing the ladder obviously offering money back guarantee This is risk reversal, right? Like a customer wants to know that they spend all this money on your product that you will offer money back And then the last one is motivate your customers to take action Um push them over the edge remind them of the value that you create And the value that's inside of their product on the based on the problem that you've solved So that is a wrap on the seven part blueprint to creating a high converting gumroad sales page So now we're going to go over some other essentials Um that I think are vital to your sales page So the first one being your cover photo We're going to go over how to make a great first impression with your cover photo So why in the digital world your first impression matters your first impression sets the tone for everything else that follows You can either make a good impression or a bad impression So in that case of your gumroad sales page your cover photo is that first impression? This is the first thing every customer will see having a terrible cover photo and you subconsciously subconsciously tell a consumer that your product is not of high value Or a spectacular cover photo and you subconsciously tell the customer that your product is packaged value This makes an impression and gets the consumer to continue scanning your sales page So let's go over some examples Blake emuls launchables. So two things that I love about his his Cover photo he kills two birds with one stone as they say as you scan from left to right You'll first see social proof and then secondly, you'll see a headline that supports the social proof The social social proof showcases the results on the back end of the product Right right here. It shows him or it shows How much he's generated from launching some products in You know in the 15 days and then the headline tells you exactly what the product does for you Monetize the digital product in 15 days with the help from a group perfect example The second is battle act as overlord What I really like about battle is that the fact that he uses his cover section to showcase a product video And in his 37 second video he communicates. 

What is overlord? What you can do with overload and how to use overload So developing a product video is a perfect way to address pain points and clearly communicate how you solve them And it's a way to to basically say a lot and a little bit of time, right? That's why I like it. Uh, if you look at battle access overlords video, you'll know what I mean So next session we're going to go over is writing effective headlines and why you should write your headlines first So the reason being is because when we land on the sales page Our eyes automatically beam to the first headline on the page and then ongoing from there We continue to scroll and read only the headlines. This is naturally what we do as humans It's that the headlines are bigger text than the copy and therefore we scan and if it peaks our interest That's when we'll read the copy And if you look at the statistics 80 percent of people will only read the headlines Meaning that it's an it's essential to write effective headlines and not just headlines that that capture attention But that also evoke action because a customer should be able to only read your headlines and know What problem you solve and in most cases a customer should be able to read only your headlines And take action based on your headlines. 

You have to think as your of your copy as a supporting context to your headlines So here are the best practices the first is a consumer should only read your headline And know what problems you use address how your product solves the problem the benefits of your products How your product is better than others who has used your product and the success customers have achieved with your product Collectively this formulates headlines That inspire customers to take action through the information education and the social proof you provide from here Your copy is used as a supportive context to bring your headlines to life so Personally when I write headlines for Any sales page I want my headlines to flow starting with the big bold idea The big problem the big promise ongoing. I want it to flow as for example, like a continuous story So if someone reads my headlines I'm almost telling them this like micro story told by just one-liners about my product and what my product does for them and the in the more the better, uh, you can write these headlines That are clear and concise and not trying to be clever and witty Then the the the more you're going to have a higher chance of converting these customers in this section We're going to go over how your story is your social proof and why your transformation matters most This is something I think is heavily overlooked by creators meaning not too many creators share their story and their transformation to then inspire and motivate consumers to take action and the reason I think it's it's Overlooked a lot of times is because they don't understand that showing how they got from A to Z Positions your product as a solution for another consumer that wants to get from A to Z. So let's dive into why But first let's look at over this example, so this is an example from the cold email wizard I know we've used a lot of his his gum road sales pages for a lot of examples and well It's because he has a great sales page. It's it converts at a high percentage And he has a Slew of customers, right? He's becoming a top gum road creator and there's a lot to learn from what he does One of the best things that he he does on his sales page is he has a whole section on On where he shares his story and he shares his transformation, right? So like this is the the first block where he describes how he became the cold email wizard And again, he shares how he faced a certain problem and he created his own solution to his problem then Now he packaged that solution and is selling that Solution as his product to other consumers who are also facing that problem And what this does best is sharing your transformation is the best way to show And sell that you can transform someone else because if you did it for yourself Then you could do it for others and that positions you as a leader and as the guide to help somebody get from A to Z Don't kind of touch in on what I just said But your transformation is the best way to sell your products If you can prove that you've been through the same transformation that customers dream of then you can sell it to them This is what makes your story the ultimate social proof and by transforming yourself customers will now see you as the guide to help them Transform their lives simply if you created the solution for yourself, then you can sell it to others So let's look over some of the best practices Share your transformation on your sales page show how you also face related problems and created a solution that helped transform your life This can be done through a video in your header image or by adding a section where you share your story It's very simple. 

It's very straightforward that the best way to show like Display and help a customer visualize themselves succeeding is by sharing your own story Show how you overcame that same problem. You found a solution. Matter of fact, you created the solution You created it for yourself And then now you've packaged that solution to help people that were in the same position as you were not long ago So earlier I told you to write for the scanners, right? I wanted you to write effective headlines But now you also want to write for the readers, right? So how to write effective copy that supports your headlines The reason this is essential is because if you are writing your effective headlines Then you are going to get uh consumers to read the copy that supports it And when you do you want to make sure that this copy sells the headline it makes the headline Uh come to life and be true in the mind of the consumer So how do you do that and why when you write for scanners you want to put an you put an emphasis on the headline When you write for the readers you put an emphasis on making those headlines believable This is the magic of writing for both because they complement each other Think of your headlines as the hook and your supporting copy as the water that brings the plant to life So here's some of the best practices Someone visits your gum road page and only scans your headlines You still want them to take action because of this your h1 is your bold brilliant idea that you're trying to sell every following headline Supports this idea and your supporting copy gives rich details that give customers the confidence to believe in your brilliant idea And that's the key here. 

You want to use your copy as As the the supporting context that they believe every bold headline that you write So use this copy to share the process how it works and how it becomes a reality So that you can leave no stern no stone unturned and so customers will take action of full confidence So the way I always see it is your headline is the attention grabber the one that peaks the interest and then my Copy is the confidence builder. It's the it's the piece of the of the puzzle that Gives the consumer all the confidence to take action because a consumer that's not confident In their purchase decision is obviously not one that's going to act You want to leave no stone unturned so that your consumer feels completely confident in their decision All right. So now we're going to go over what I call show what's included which is how to make consumers confident in their purchase The reason I believe this is so important is because a confident customer is a customer that takes action the more confidence you could instill in a customer in a customer, sorry the more of a Chance that you have of converting them and create and turning them into a customer Because no one takes action when they don't feel confident Right. 

And so that's in What we're going to go over is how to increase the confidence in these consumers so that they do take action and they do purchase your products So here's an example from blakey mall. We've used blake In a few examples already. And so in this one particularly what I really like that he does with again his launchables course Is the fact that he he gives an inside look of what the course curriculum is and Because again the whole idea behind his course is We're going to launch a product Um in 50 he's going to teach you how to launch a product in 15 days with the help of a community and with the help of a group Um when you hear that it's like in theory, it sounds great But you're like how how am I going to do this? And so basically he tackles all of the objections that you have By showing the curriculum what you're going to go through right before you start. 

This is what's going to happen. Here's how we're going to create Different ideas how we're going to generate ideas that you can use to launch then how you're going to build it from everything right from packaging from marketing and then launching it so he's literally showing you the blueprint to How you're going to get to the end result that he promises which is launching that product Within a within a certain time frame because if you could show the blueprint And you could show how things are done and you could show the consumer Look, this is what i'm going to put you through. This is what you're going to get from me, right? I'm promising all of this, but this is how I make it happen Then you're creating that again. 

You're creating that confidence in the consumer that That this is the right choice. I've been facing x problem And now I want to solve it in this curriculum this breakdown this blueprint is how i'm going to get there So why I I kind of already touched on this but the best way for a customer to feel confident in their purchase is to Showcase everything they're getting with their purchase This will ensure that they know their money is well spent The last thing you want is for a customer to feel hesitant about purchasing your product The more you can reassure a customer the more confidence they will have take they will have when taking action And so let's break down the best practices And let's keep it simple, too If you're writing an e-book show the chapters right you you're if this e-book tackles a certain problem showing the chapters is almost like Breaking down the blueprint um With for example with sahil and his uh, his new Newly released book the minimalist entrepreneur He he breaks down erie shows an inside look of each chapter and what you're going to learn from each chapter that's going to then Help you become a minimalist entrepreneur. This is him giving away the blueprint, right? It's a secret sauce It's it's how you're going to get from a to b So if you're creating a video course show all the video lessons you plan on teaching If you're creating a membership share all the exclusive content that's that's included Some gum road creators even share content that gives an inside look to the content. 

So maybe if You could get some people on your email list. For example by giving them an exclusive, uh piece of content That's only exclusive to a member or a membership, right? These are different ways to make the consumer feel comfortable Okay So the last section we're going to go over is seo making google work for you and gum road a matter of fact So making google and gum road work for you So why there are 5.6 billion google searches a day and thousands of searches via gum road discover Because of because of this is essential to optimize your government sales page to To rank on both search engines like google and on gum road Not only is this free traffic, but also quality traffic with high intent The more you can optimize your gum road sales page to meet search needs the more your gum road product will appear on gum roads explore page there are some creators Who drive over five figures of revenue a month from ranking on the explore page? And so why is google important or why is gum road discover important? So I I like to compare it to if you're running paid ads you are literally paying to send traffic that you're uh, for example traffic or you're sending traffic from people that you are interrupting on let's say a
