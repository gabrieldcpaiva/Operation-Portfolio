Now we're going to look at Chase Diamond's sales page. We've looked at Blakey malls. In the next video, you're going to look at Cold Email Mastery, which is $215.

Of course, Blakey malls was a $12 kind of notion template. And now in the middle, this is a $49 product. It's not too low, it's not too high, but it's packed with value. 

So let's dive in. So the first thing is his headline, Master Email Forms and Welcome Messages by Chase Diamond. So he essentially tells you what you're going to do. 

You're going to master email collection forms and welcome messages. Very, very straightforward. You know what you're getting. 

There's not really any confusion to this, which is good because as a consumer, you don't want to be confused when you land on a sales page. You want to know if I'm spending money, what am I getting from that money? What am I going to learn? What problem is this product going to solve? And so it tells you from the beginning that you're going to master the email collection forms and welcome messages. And then he tells you what the product is. 

The master email collection forms and welcome messages is a PDF that covers how 20 brands approach this. And so if you know Chase, Chase works with eight and nine figure brands specifically on their email marketing and their SMS. So he's literally taking these case studies and he's taking past campaigns and templates from these brands and putting them into a PDF.

And so he tells you what the product essentially is. It's a PDF and what's like the meat and potatoes of the PDF. Well, it's how 20 brands approach their email collection forms and their welcome messages.

And then he goes into exactly what it is, like what what the context of that PDF is. So for each brand, you'll see email pop up form comer confirmation slash thank you page in the first welcome email. You exactly know what you're going to get.

You're going to get 20 brand campaign and templates that show you the email pop up the form confirmation in the first welcome email. And then he also includes a few extra bonuses, which is what I really like is when when people kind of add on like your your this is what the product is. But you're also going to get a little bit of more.

So you're going to get insights on three types of form offers. So now that you know the forms that these brands are using, well, you're going to see what their actual offers look like so that you can replicate them so that you could take them, use them and start getting results. And you're also going to know how to set up different forms on mobile versus desktop.

This is important if if if you want to be offering like if you're creating landing pages and forms for your mobile and desktop, it's essential to make sure that they're working efficiently on each. And so he's going to show you how to do this. Plus, three bonus examples showing how forms we've built are performing any associated behavior.

What I really like about this, this sales page is he actually shows you one of the 20 brands covered in the PDF so that you're so you have like this expectation of, OK, I see. The inside of this, I see an actual brand he's worked with, you see the email pop up the SMS pop up. The thank you page, right, like the welcome email, the SMS message, you see all this, you see, wow, like I'm going to get 19 more of these.

And I'm sure there's a copy that that comes with this, but you're seeing an inside look to the product, which now like if you if you were guessing of what you were getting for your money, now you understand what you are getting. And then that's a big element before someone actually gives you their credit card or whatever their their debit card to purchase your product after showing an insight to the products. He's showing what the product generates the value that comes for the product by displaying a ton of social proof.

So this area here, this is a perfect recipe for for a kind of medium priced item. It's not too expensive. It's not too inexpensive.

It's forty nine dollars. You don't need to write out the most the craziest sales page you've ever seen. You just need to show people what they're getting, what the product look like, looks like an inside look to the product and then a ton of social proof.

So that the value that they're getting is more than the price that they're going to pay. And if you could literally use this replicate it for your own product, this is a great sales page.
